# UVA Accessibility
This app will serve as a resource to persons on grounds in need of accessibility accomodations. It will have functionalities to give people directions for accesible pathways on Grounds, connect them to SDAC resources, and allow them to report any barrier to access.

## Milestone
The Report a Barrier functionality of the app is complete. In doing so, I tackled the optional features of using the camera/photo library to take a photo of the barrier and open shared activity/ features via drafting an email to send to SDAC.
